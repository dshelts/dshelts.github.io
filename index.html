					<p>This webpage is in its infancy and My hope is that this webpage becomes a place for inspiration and creativity to live and thrive. Through out most of my young life I was fairly certain that I would be involved in the art world in one way or another. I was discouraged from practicing art as a way to make money, but because of this I felt like I was going to lose part of myself. So as one thing led to another I began to study computer science at Wheaton College and this webpage was born.</p>
