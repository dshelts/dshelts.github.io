					<h1>All Set Fow Now</h1>
					<p>By: Lily Allen</p>
					<p>Once upon a time there was an owl. The owl was a funny looking thing when it hatched, and as it grew older the owl looked even more strange. It became so big that its small, awkward wings couldn't carry it in flight. Its neck stretched out like a turtle's and its legs became long and stocky like two sapling trunks. And strangest of all was the owls face.</p>
					<p>The owl's face didn't look at all like an owl's face ought to. Instead its feathery cheeks framed a human nose, human lips, and eyes that looked human except for being completely black like an owl's.</p>
					<p>Besides looking hideous and frightening to the other owls, this owl couldn't do the same things the others could because of his neck, wings, and legs.</p>
					<p>One day the strange owl could no longer stand living alone in its tree so it decided to leave, hoping to find somewhere more fitting and more like home. Leaving the tree was difficult without proper use of its wings, but the owl used its long legs and large talons to step down branch by branch.</p>
					<p>On the ground the owl's face kept it safe from predators who feared its strange visage. It walked on by night when the echoes of its favorite dreams seemed to dangle from the stars like loose threads or life lines.</p>
					<p>It's thick, strong legs carried it to a river in the heart of the forest. The river whispered in melodic tones and the water shone silver from the stars as they swam the blue-black sky above and dropped life lines into the stream below.</p>
					<p>The owl stared in gaping wonder. In its tree it had only seen peeking stars through the leaves and water only when it rained grey. Seeing its silver life lines floating on the river's surface, the owl stepped confidently into the shallows.</p>
					<p>The water was not cold and miserably wet like the grey rain and it felt gentle as a blanket of fog as the owl waded in. It snapped at the life lines with its human mouth and reached out with its owl wings and its thick legs carried it further into the depths. The owl's snatches became increasingly determined until its long neck plunged beneath the whispering current. The owl was surrounded by the silver nebula that echoed its dreams and each ungainly limb began to move effortlessly in the aquatic drift.</p>
					<p>The owl let bubbles out of its human nose and stirred water with its owl tail. The silver galaxy reflected on its wide black eyes and seeped in to fill its small heart with warmth.</p>
					<p>In that moment the owl was swallowed whole by a large blue fish with a toothless smile and a soft pink tongue. The owl with the stars in its eyes found itself in the stomach of the large blue fish and was not afraid. In the fish, the owl could talk without being seen for its face, could fly through the silver without using its stunted wings, and live in the pink belly of the fish without worry or care, seeing only the silver stars that echoed the owl's dreams.</p>
